### Group members (exam number):

It contains the following three projects:
* Dataproject: "Monty Python"
	* Examining data of approximately 10.000 movies from the IMDb-website. Here we take a look at ratings for different genres of movies, e.g. how these are correlated. Furthermore we look at ratings over time and ratings for movies with more award wins/nominations

* Modelproject: "Python's Next Top Model"
	* Digging further into the IMDb-data from the dataproject, we now begin to examine how well we can describe each movies rating by their genres, length, year of publicity, and so on. By using a simple model calculating ratings based on these porperties we estimate preferences for movies, using a Minimized Squared Difference-method

* Examproject: "Beautiful Minds Think Alike"
	* Our submission of the exam questions. 

Each of the projects are contained in their own folder.

Furthermore it contains an overview of each members feedback given to other projects in the file: "Feedback.txt"
