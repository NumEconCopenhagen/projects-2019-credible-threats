# Dataproject

All you need to see our project is the notebook "Monty Python.ipynb". It includes all the code and all the figures. The data is the 'imdb.csv' and is the second file in this folder. All the subfolders are our temporary code-files, and they are NOT necessary to use because everything is collected in "Monty Python.ipynb".
