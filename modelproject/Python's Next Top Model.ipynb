    "Welcome back to the wonderful Python universe of Credible Threats. We will continue the exploration of movies, and we're sure that our data project notebook will look at this notebook and think, *you complete me*. You might want to ask, *Magic mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all*, and the answer will be this notebook. This notebook will try to estimate the IMDb ratings of movies. And as a bonus, we even have a live-updating figure, which will leave you thinking, *it's alive, it's alive*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will calculate the utility of each movie, given genres, awards, duration and so forth, and we will try to calculate the IMDb ratings for each movie, based on this utility. Finally, we will minimize the distance between our estimated ratings and the actual IMDb ratings. Now, we're sure you're thinking, *show me the money*, so this is it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our utility function is given by: \n",
