For example if the parameter for action-movies were negative, the prediction would be precise, if action-movies generally had a negative impact on ratings. Of course people have much different preferences, and an interesting analysis would be, to predict preferences for different people, and by this look at a distribution of these parameters. This is not included in this project, though. <br>\n",

When all movies are included in the optimizer the lowest ranking movies will have ratings around 2. Our rating predictor will in this case not rank any movies under 5. Thereby it is clear that the predictor model is not able to predict movies with very low rating. But it is able to predict movies with higher rating."

    "Ideally our model would predict movie ratings perfectly, and thereby our parameters would perfectly describe the general preferences for movies. Whether this is possible, even with an advanced model, is not sure. People have different preferences, and two movies that would seem identical in our dataset, based on genres, duration, time of release, etc. could have very different ratings. Therefore som devitaion in our prediction from the true ratings are expected. <br>\n",
    "The left graphs above plot the mean of deviations based on genres, duration, decades, and true ratings. The right graphs plot the number of movies in the dataset based on the same groups. From these graphs we see a clear correlation between precision and number of movies in the dataset. The more movies of a given genre, duration, etc. the more precise the prediction of movie-ratings in these groups. Take drama-movies as an example. The mean of the deviation is close to zero, and movies of this genre is also quite overrepresentated in the dataset. The complete opposite case is short-movies. But we also see that sci-fi-movies are quite well predicted, even though there aren't relatively many of these movies in the dataset. The same is seen in other different genres. <br>\n",
