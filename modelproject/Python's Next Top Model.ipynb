    "If the model would predict all movie ratings correctly the parameters would perfectly describe movie preferences. For example if the parameter for action-movies were negative, the prediction would be precise, if action-movies generally had a negative impact on ratings. Of course people have much different preferences, and an interesting analysis would be, to predict preferences for different people, and by this look at a distribution of these parameters. This is not included in this project, though. <br>\n",
    "To shorten the length of the optimizing process, and to sort out movies that makes it harder for the model to predict preferences, the optimization can be based on the top n movies, based on IMDb rating. When all movies are included in the optimizer the lowest ranking movies will have ratings around 2. Our rating predictor will in this case not rank any movies under 5. Thereby it is clear that the predictor model is not able to predict movies with very low rating. But it is able to predict movies with higher ratings."

The mean of the deviation is close to zero, and movies of this genre is also quite overrepresentated in the dataset. The complete opposite case is short-movies.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above analysis, we conclude that our model is not very precise at predicting IMDb ratings when we consider our full sample. That being said, as we limit our sample size, either by decade, or by number of movies, our model performs better. This, however, might be the result of a decreased sample size, and the model must fit fewer observations. As can be seen from the optimization with the 500, 1000 and 2000 top rated movies, our model is best at predicting the top 500 movies. Similarly, our model preforms better in the first 3, or the very last decade, which are the decades that contain the lowest number of movies. Additionally, we know from the swarm plot in our data project, that movies in the early decades have a lower variation in ratings which, just as when we restrict our sample to top rated movies, decreases the number of possible ratings to estimates, which simplifies the task for our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seem from figure 3, duration appears to increase ratings by quite a lot, while Nr. of nominations and Nr. of wins doesn't appear to play a role, at least in the later decades. Meanwhile, the effect of different genres and decades are quite different. We see that genres like Action and Horror have very little effect on ratings, while the Fantasy movies appear to be very popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from figure 4, our model is quite good at predicting rating for SciFi, Drama and Comedy, while it misses on genres like shorts and Documentaries. The latter might be explained by the fact, that these genres contain quite few observations, and these observations might have quite different ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model might be improved by including additional information such as budget, box office, director, actors, etc., which is information we do not have access to. Therefore, we conclude, that *much to learn, we still have*. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we hope you enjoyed our movie model project. \n",
