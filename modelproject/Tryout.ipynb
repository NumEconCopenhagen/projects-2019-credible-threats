    "If the model could predict all movie ratings correctly the parameters would perfectly describe movie preferences. For example if the parameter for action-movies were negative, the prediction would be precise, if action-movies generally had a negative impact on ratings. Of course people have much different preferences, and an interesting analysis would be, to predict preferences for different people, and by this look at a distribution of these parameters. This is not included in this project, though, mainly because of we don't have the data for it. <br>\n",
    "To shorten the length of the optimizing process, and to sort out movies that makes it harder for the model to predict preferences, the optimization can be based on the top n movies, based on IMDb rating. When all movies are included in the optimizer the lowest ranking movies will have ratings around 2. Our rating predictor will in this case not rank any movies under 5. Thereby it is clear that the predictor model is not able to predict movies with very low rating. But it is able to predict movies with higher ratings."

    "By runing the code below you can see a live-updating graph that shows the value of the sum of the squared difference for each iteration. As you will see, the sqaured difference reaches close to its minimum very quickly so the last 10,000 iterations almost don't change the value of the squard difference. The live-graph slows the optimizer down, so choose option live_graph=False, if you are impacient and don't care about an awesome live-updating graph."

    "As also showed in the list above, duration is the varaible that effects the ratings the most. This is also the case when the model is solved for top 500, 1000, and 2000 rated movies, cf. figure 3. However, it seems like duration is the only estimate which is fairly stable. The sign of the decade dummies is an example. When the model is solved for the entire sample, the estimates are positive for the older decade-dummies, i.e. the 1920s and 1930s, and negative for the newer decade-dummies, the 2000s and 2010s. However, when the sample only contains the top 2000 rated movies we see the opposite picture. We know from figure 10 in our dataproject that the ratings of the younger movies have a larger variance with more high-rated movies but also a lot of poorly rated movies. By restricting the sample to only the best movies we drop all the bad new movies, and this is probably the reason to the positive estimates of the newer movies. "

    "Ideally our model would predict movie ratings perfectly, and thereby our parameters would perfectly describe the general preferences for movies. Whether this is possible, even with an advanced model, is not sure. People have different preferences, and two movies that would seem identical in our dataset, based on genres, duration, time of release, etc. could have very different ratings. Therefore some devitaion in our prediction from the true ratings are expected. For that reason, this section will explore how well our model describe the actual ratings, and why some estimates are more reliable than others."

    "Figure 6 shows the final robustness check, how the estimates vary when the sample only contains movies from one deacde. Going through the different variables, it is hard to find a generel trend. E.g. the estimates of action movies are negative in some decades and positive in other decades. On the other hand, the estimates of war movies are negative for all but two decades, and duration has positive estimates in all decades. <br>\n",
    "The messy picture could be caused by too small samples whereby the estimates will be very volatile. Another reason could be that the preferences change. By looking at the estimates of drama movies you could make the arguement that the the genre of drama affect the ratings positively for old movies, but the opposite after the 1950s. This could be an indication that people have less preferences for newer drama movies compared to older drama movies."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above results, it appears that duration increases ratings by quite a lot, while Nr. of nominations and Nr. of wins doesn't appear to play a role. Meanwhile, the effect of different genres and decades are quite different. We see that genres like Action and Horror have very little effect on ratings, while the Fantasy movies appear to have a signifiant positive marginal effect on ratings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our estimates are not precise though, but this is to be expected. It is very difficult to create a model that predicts ratings like these 100 pct. right (if it is even possible with the given variables). Our robustness checks shows, that estimates are volatile to whether only top movies are included and how many of these are included, as shown in figure 4. This volatility is probably a combination of model misspecification and changing preferences. Additionally, genres could have very different distributions (e.g. the best movies are often action-movies, but there are A LOT of bad action movies as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to deal with this volatility could be to consider another functional form of the model or maybe find other variables that could improve how well the model predicts ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you enjoyed our movie model project, and don't think we are completely idiots. Because as our model we conclude that *much to learn, we still have*. \n",
